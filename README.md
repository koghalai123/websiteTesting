SO far, there are 3 projects. The websites are all written in Python with Django.

The first is a test website to see how it DJango works(my_tennis_website)

The second is a chess website which will eventually have multiple AI models that users can play against, named after different family members based on skill level(chessWebsite)

The last is a home automation system which provides voice and online control of devices, although APIs to physical devices are not yet available. These build off an existing project for the voice ommands(https://github.com/koghalai123/practice_with_LLM.git)
The project is named homeAutomation
